Use a refund token
If you’re only wondering how you can earn free V-Bucks because you spent your last one on a skin that you didn’t like, fear not. All Fortnite accounts are granted three refund tokens, which allow them to return the cosmetics they bought and get back their precious V-Bucks.

This method only gives you back the V-Bucks that you spent on the skin that you return, though, and the cap on tokens will limit their usage. It’s still worth using them to get your V-Bucks back for a purchase that you weren’t satisfied with.

Every year, players will be given one refund token. This change was implemented in Patch 18.2. Before that, players would run out of refunds forever after using all of them.

Though accidental purchases happen, a refund system such as this one is necessary to prevent players from abusing the system. If that wasn’t the case, most players would purchase a skin and wear it for a few days only to refund it, which would damage Epic’s revenue stream.

Honorable mentions
These methods aren’t entirely free, but if you’re already going to spend money on Fortnite, you might as well follow them to get more bang for your buck.

Unlock the V-Bucks rewards in your battle pass
The battle pass itself costs money, but you can earn back your investment and then some. Fortnite has been allowing players to only unlock the tiers that they like in the battle pass, meaning players can unlock the V-Buck rewards immediately if they have enough Battle Stars.

Once you start profiting from your initial battle pass investment, you can save up the additional V-Bucks and use them to purchase other cosmetics that you may like. fdfd

FAQ
Will using GearUP Booster result in a ban?

How does GearUP Booster reduce ping in Fortnite?
Internet connections are complex, and each player's connection to Fortnite servers varies due to a range of factors. Your current connection path may not be optimal, but GearUP can assist in finding the best route while avoiding unstable paths.
